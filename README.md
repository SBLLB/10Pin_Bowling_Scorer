##10-Pin Bowling Scorer


#### Count and sum the scores of a one-player bowling game in javascript. Weekend Challenge, Week 5 at Makers Academy.


###The Objective

Write a program in Javascript that counts and sums the scores of a bowling game. Take into account the following:

+ A bowling game consists of 10 frames
+ In every frame the player can throw one or two times, the actual number depending on strikes and spares
+ A Strike = all 10 pins knocked down with the first roll of a frame
+ A Spare = all 10 pins knocked down within the two rolls of a frame
+ The bonus for a strike iis the number of pins knocked down by the next two rolls (the next frame)
+ The bonus for a spare is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll (first role of next frame)
+ If the player rolls a strike or spare in the 10th frame he can roll the additional balls for the bonus
+ A Player can never roll more than 3 balls in the 10th frame
+ The additional rolls in the 10th frame only count for the bonus, not the regular frame count
+ A Gutter Game is when the player never hits a pin (20 zero scores)
+ A Perfect Game is when the player rolls 12 strikes (10 regular strikes and 2 strikes for the bonus in the 10th frame). The Perfect Game scores to 300 points.
